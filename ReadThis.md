This project will be wrapped around in electron to make it a desktop application.

Electron is important for desktop app development as it allows developers to use web technologies to build cross-platform applications. 
This simplifies the development process and makes it more accessible to web developers. 

Popular applications built using Electron include code editors like Visual Studio Code and Atom, communication tools like Slack and Discord, video conferencing software like Zoom, and music players like Spotify. 

These applications have gained widespread popularity due to their cross-platform capabilities and user-friendly interfaces, made possible by the features provided by the Electron framework.
